## Project Setup
Basic project setup was done with Create React App v5.0.1

## Misc
Although I read that there'll be bonus points for using Typescript, unfortunately, I have no experience with Typescript yet.

Thus, I proceeded with vanilla js to show my best performance which would be better than cramming Typescript with Udemy course in one or two days and showing off a 'half-baked' code.
