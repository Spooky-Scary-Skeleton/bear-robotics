## Misc
Although I read that there'll be bonus points for using Typescript, unfortunately, I have no experience with Typescript yet.

Thus, I proceeded with vanilla js to show my best performance which would be better than cramming Typescript with Udemy course in one or two days and showing off a 'half-baked' code.â—Š
